# Covid-19 Bar Chart Race in Caribean Region
  Covid-19 has spread around the world. Since March 2020, and the first confirmed case occured in Caribbean region. It inspired me to draw a bar chart race, to demonstrate the increase of confirmed cases in different countries. To some extent, it could infer the situation about the countries dealing with the pandemic.
